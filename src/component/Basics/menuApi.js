    description: "Hey foodies!! I am up with a new recipe. This is one of famous dishes in India and is loved by everyone. As the name suggests it is made of cottage cheese and made in a Kadai but even if you don't have Kadai you can make it . This dish takes a bit of time to make but it is worth that time. Author's note : This is the recipe I usually make when there is an occasion or guests are coming over my house. In lockdown I made this recipe at my granny's home and everyone liked it, There I made large quantity as there were 12-13 people to cook for. "
